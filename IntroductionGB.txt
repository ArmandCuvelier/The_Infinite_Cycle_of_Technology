In an apocalyptic world, humanity has survived and gathered in small factions. The largest of them, the Archipelago, has been the most influential for over a century.
Its council, made up of the elders of this young civilization, has been ruling all the factions for several decades by enforcing laws.
The most important of these laws is the prohibition of possessing artifacts and books from the ancient civilization.
