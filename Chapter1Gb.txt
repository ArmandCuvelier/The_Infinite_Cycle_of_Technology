Chapter 1
After a few days of travel, you arrive at the most important faction of the civilization: The Archipelago.
This bustling city is filled with people. Despite the crowd, you spot the bar << Error 404. >>
Sneaking through the crowd, you spot the bartender, Dany, and approach him.
Dany << Are you here from Remi? Take this drink, it's on the house. >>
-Take the drink and drink it (Y)
-Say you're not thirsty (N)
You explain your objective to him.
Dany << As a bartender, I've heard a lot about this. Apparently, the relics confiscated by the council could reveal more about the ancient world.>>
You ask where you can access the relics.
Dany << It's forbidden to the public, but I heard the sewers might be a way in. >>
You thank him and head to a small alley far from the crowds, where you find a manhole cover.

You sneak into the sewers. Soon, you come across a crossroads. An arrow points right, indicating the council's location.
You choose:
-Left (L)
-Right (R)
Trusting the sign, you follow it and arrive in front of a ladder. It leads you into a kitchen. You continue to explore the area and finally come face to face with what you were looking for.
Unfortunately, a grate blocks your way.
At that moment, a guard surprises you and attacks.

Unfortunately, the fight made a lot of noise, and it was enough to raise the alarm.
You begin to run and retrace your steps:
-The kitchen
-The sewers
-The alley
You find yourself back in the central square, where many guards are searching for you...
One option remains: flee...
