Chapter 3:
You leave Lionel’s place and head toward Samuel’s mine.
After more than three hours of walking, you luckily stumble upon a mine entrance. You step inside.
You see light and wonder if someone is there.
No response.
You ask again, mentioning Lionel.
A man steps out of the shadows.
The man << Rah, Lionel, always talking about me... >>
It was Samuel.
Samuel << Explain to me why you’re here? >>
You explain in detail the reason for your visit.
Samuel << Alright, alright. Listen, the mine is a real labyrinth, so memorize my instructions carefully, okay? >>
Samuel << Left, left, right, left, right, right, right, and finally left. One mistake, and you say goodbye. >>
Hint: Left corresponds to L, and right to R.
You’ve gained a skill point. Would you like to allocate it to HP, DEF, or ATK? (H/D/A)
You arrive in an abandoned room, but Samuel is there.
Samuel << Ah, welcome. This is what you were looking for, am I right? >>
You receive an Ancient PC.
Samuel << By the way, tell Lionel that it’s missing a 3008 processor, RAM, and cables! >>
You thank him and leave the mine, but a dark creature blocks your path and attacks you.

After defeating it, you notice the creature had a small black box in its teeth.
You take it to show Lionel.
Back at his hideout, you show it to him.
Lionel << Wow, you found RAM, and with the cables I have, we’re only missing the processor to get the computer running. >>
Lionel << But bad news, we’ll need to visit a man named Dominique to get one. He lives five minutes from here in a cube-shaped stone house. >>
You hurry to visit Dominique before night falls.
Arriving at the described house, you knock.
A man answers, and you explain that you’ve come on behalf of Lionel.
The man << I’m Dominique. I’m willing to give you the processor if you play a game. >>
Dominique << In the past, the old civilization used to play a game called ‘rock, paper, scissors.’ The rules are simple: at the same time, each player chooses rock, scissors, or paper. Paper beats rock, rock beats scissors, and scissors beat paper. >>
Dominique << I propose we play. If you win, you get your processor. If you lose, you die and will serve as part of my research. >>
Terrified, you decide to accept.
Help: Paper corresponds to P, rock to R, and scissors to S.
You’ve gained a skill point. Would you like to allocate it to HP, DEF, or ATK? (H/D/A)
Dominique << Thank you, this has helped me advance my research. Here’s your processor. >>
You thank him and rush back to Lionel.
Upon returning to Lionel’s, you quickly assemble the computer and start playing the USB drive.
After an hour of watching, you understand the cause of the apocalypse:
The limits of technology were reached. Humanity, driven by its insatiable desire for more, nearly caused its own extinction.
